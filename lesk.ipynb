    "The best result were shown by sophisticated methods by Liling Tan. Actually, he also co-authored [NLTK WSD](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/wsd.html) module of NLTK toolset, along with Dmitrijs Milajevs, but for some reasons, with our dataset, Lesk algorithm from NLTK worked worse than any other alternative, even mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in this light, my implemenatations look not so bad, however, as we can see, sometimes good choice was just meaningless coincedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the best score (by Tan's algorithms) was just 3 of 10. We should keep in mind that it's just one sample from the corpus, and I am not sure we could get even the same score consistenly on other samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it's worth to mention, that WordNet as itself is a bad source (BTW as a project it was discontinued years ago). Some meanings seems to be the same one, but separated for some reasons. I could conclude the task of aligning token/sentence to WordNet synset is not really reasonable. We rather should relate them to entities we are going (and are able) to use. For example, if we implement search engine, it makes sense to produce embeddings which are based on our corpus and then to relate new texts (tokens, sentences) to our embeddings, than to weird WordNet synsets.\n",

    "1. Tan is cool, but any algorhitmic implementation is not so good for production.\n",
    "2. WordNet is bad, don't use it.\n",
    "3. ML seems to be only possible way out to deal with WSD, at least, without much pain."
